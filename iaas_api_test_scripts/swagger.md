Swagger is a suite of tools for API developers from SmartBear Software and a former specification upon which the OpenAPI Specification is based. 
Swagger is an open source set of rules, specifications and tools for developing and describing RESTful APIs. The Swagger framework allows developers to create interactive, machine and human-readable API documentation.

Swagger helps users build, document, test and consume RESTful web services. It can be used with both a top-down and bottom-up API development approach. In the top-down, or design-first, method, Swagger can be used to design an API before any code is written. In the bottom-up, or code-first method, Swagger takes the code written for an API and generates the documentation.

### Components of Swagger
Swagger provides a variety of open source tools for APIs, including:

- Swagger Editor- This enables developers to write documentation for, design and describe new APIs as well as edit existing ones. The browser-based editor visually renders OpenAPI specifications, handles errors and provides real-time feedback.
- Swagger Codegen- This gives developers the ability to generate client library code and SDKs for different platforms.
- Swagger User Interface- This is a fully customizable tool that helps engineers generate documentation for various platforms. It can be hosted in any environment.
- Swagger Inspector- This is a testing tool for API documentation. APIs can be easily validated without limits and results are automatically saved and accessed in the cloud.

### Benefits of Swagger
In addition to its goal of standardizing and simplifying API practices, a few additional benefits of Swagger are:

- It has a friendly user interface that maps out the blueprint for APIs.
- Documentation is comprehensible for both developers and non-developers like clients or project managers.
- Specifications are human and machine readable.
- Generates interactive, easily testable documentation.
- Supports the creation of API libraries in over 40 languages.
- Format is acceptable in JSON and YAML to enable easier edits.
- Helps automate API-related processes.
